## Stop your Jupyter Hub and save work

If you are in Jupyter lab in the browser:

- File > Hub Control Panel > Stop my server

If you are in RStudio and you still have the Jupyter lab tab open in your browser:

- Go to the Jupyter lab tab
- File > Hub Control Panel > Stop my server

If you are in RStudio and you do not have the Jupyter lab tab open in your browser because you closed that tab:

- Go to the url `https://<jupyterhub url>/user/<your username in the hub>/lab/` That will open the Jupyter lab tab
- File > Hub Control Panel > Stop my server
