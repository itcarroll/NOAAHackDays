### 2. GitHub Account

A GitHub account is required to gain access to the JupyterHub and to clone the tutorials used in the Hackhours.

### 3. When done, please stop the JupyterHub

If you are in Jupyter lab in the browser:

- File > Hub Control Panel > Stop my server

If you are in RStudio and you still have the Jupyter lab tab open in your browser:

- Go to the Jupyter lab tab
- File > Hub Control Panel > Stop my server

If you are in RStudio and you do not have the Jupyter lab tab open in your browser because you closed that tab:
