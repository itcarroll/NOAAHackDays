        "## Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example we will use the `earthaccess` library to search for data collections from NASA Earthdata. `earthaccess` is a Python library that simplifies data discovery and access to NASA Earth science data by providing an abstraction layer for NASAâ€™s [Common Metadata Repository (CMR) API](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/site/docs/search/api.html) Search API. The library makes searching for data more approachable by using a simpler notation instead of low level HTTP queries. `earthaccess` takes the trouble out of Earthdata Login **authentication**, makes **search** easier, and provides a stream-line way to download or stream search results into an `xarray` object.\n",
        "\n",
        "For more on `earthaccess` visit the [`earthaccess` GitHub](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess) page and/or the [`earthaccess` documentation](https://earthaccess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) site. Be aware that `earthaccess` is under active development. \n",
