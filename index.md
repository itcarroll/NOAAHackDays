## Welcome

Use this form to sign-up to be alerted for future hackdays and Intro to JupyterHubs sessions: [SIGN-UP FORM](https://forms.gle/ckUYr4aZPeyScLRX6)

Contact or questions: Eli Holmes (NOAA) - Type my name in your NOAA email, and my contact will pop up. Note, it uses "Eli" not "Elizabeth".

See the [Workshop Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Za7lPGo7XXFXvEBwnB221auL95q-5Ra-6lWQdoha43w/edit?usp=sharing) (NOAA internal) for the link to the JupyterHub and Google Meet link.

### Fridays Hackhours in March 2024 12pm PT/3pm ET. 1 hour of geospatial in Python and R

During these 1 hour hackhours, we will use a JupyterHub set-up with geospatial packages and data. These sessions will get you more familiar with JupyterHubs, Jupyter notebooks, and Python/R for geospatial analysis.

* March 8th. Using daily precipitation data from [IMERG](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/GPM_3IMERGDF_07/summary) [tutorial](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2023-Cloud-Workshop-AGU/tutorials/Earthdata_Subset_and_Plot.html)
* March 15th. TBD. Maybe let's do a Coastwatch tutorial or GIS (via the arcgic Python API).
* March 22nd. Species distribution modeling. Let's fit a SDM using ocean climate variables (R).
* March 29th. Machine learning with tensorflow! It is not that hard. Let's do some machine-learning with SST rasters (Python).

I don't know Python? Python is not as commonly use in NMFS. There are lots of free tutorials and classes. Feel free to use the JupyterHub to run through Python course material. 


### December 19, 2023

## Stop your Jupyter Hub at the end of the day

If you are in Jupyter lab in the browser:

- File > Hub Control Panel > Stop my server

If you are in RStudio and you still have the Jupyter lab tab open in your browser:

- Go to the Jupyter lab tab
- File > Hub Control Panel > Stop my server

If you are in RStudio and you do not have the Jupyter lab tab open in your browser because you closed that tab:

- Go to the url `https://<jupyterhub url>/user/<your username in the hub>/lab/` That will open the Jupyter lab tab
- File > Hub Control Panel > Stop my server



- Close out your JupyterHub instance if you are finished for the day, following [these instructions](https://podaac.github.io/2022-SWOT-Ocean-Cloud-Workshop/tutorials/00_Setup.html#how-do-i-end-my-session).
