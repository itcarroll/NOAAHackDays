## Welcome

**The workshop will take place virtually on December 19, 2023 from 8am-3pm PT [(UTC-7)](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/pdt)**.

Contact or questions: Eli Holmes (NOAA) - Type my name in your NOAA email, and my contact will pop up. Note, it uses "Eli" not "Elizabeth".


## About

### Workshop Goals

This is a session for interested NOAA staff to gain more familiarity with JupyterHubs and working with NASA Earth Data via code and geospatial packages in R and Python. This session is part of development of larger hack day events in 2024.

- Provide an inclusive place to learn about and experience working with NASA Earthdata Cloud;
- Provide strategies and best practices for finding and accessing NASA Earthdata Cloud data. 
- Practice using remote-sensing data in R and Python with code. 
- Learn by working together on a small group project/task. 


### Workshop Description

*From the NASA (Data Centers) Openscapes mentors*:

"Earth science data, including [NASA Earthdata](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/), is increasingly more available from the cloud. By leveraging cloud compute resources, open science principles, and technologies that foster transparency and reproducibility, science can be done at rates and scales that are not achievable by using personal/local machines. Building modern data skills in a friendly environment is crucial for accelerating science and reducing barriers to inclusive scientific research."

Participants will take part in hands-on tutorials using a JupyterHub on the NOAA Azure account. The target audience is any interested NOAA staff. Note, this is a "pilot" hack day to start building content and experience in preparation for more polished multi-day events in 2024.

FAQ: Can I bring my own content/code to the event and JupyterHub? Absolutely, please do!!
