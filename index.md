## Stop your Jupyter Hub at the end of the day

If you are in Jupyter lab in the browser:

- File > Hub Control Panel > Stop my server

If you are in RStudio and you still have the Jupyter lab tab open in your browser:

- Go to the Jupyter lab tab
- File > Hub Control Panel > Stop my server

If you are in RStudio and you do not have the Jupyter lab tab open in your browser because you closed that tab:

- Go to the url `https://<jupyterhub url>/user/<your username in the hub>/lab/` That will open the Jupyter lab tab
- File > Hub Control Panel > Stop my server



- Close out your JupyterHub instance if you are finished for the day, following [these instructions](https://podaac.github.io/2022-SWOT-Ocean-Cloud-Workshop/tutorials/00_Setup.html#how-do-i-end-my-session).
