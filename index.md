## Welcome

Use this form to sign-up to be alerted for future hackdays and Intro to JupyterHubs sessions: [SIGN-UP FORM](https://forms.gle/ckUYr4aZPeyScLRX6)

Contact or questions: Eli Holmes (NOAA) - Type my name in your NOAA email, and my contact will pop up. Note, it uses "Eli" not "Elizabeth".

### Friday Hackhours in March 2024 12-1pm PT/3-4pm ET

During these 1 hour hackhours, we will learn to do cloud computing with a JupyterHub set-up with geospatial packages and data. These sessions will get you more familiar with cloud-computing, JupyterHubs, Jupyter notebooks, and Python for geospatial analysis.

[Add event to your calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MXQ4bzFuaDViZzFudHFtNWlzZjVtZ2JqZGVfMjAyNDAzMDhUMjAwMDAwWiBlbGkuaG9sbWVzQG5vYWEuZ292&tmsrc=eli.holmes%40noaa.gov&scp=ALL)

## Stop your Jupyter Hub at the end of the day

If you are in Jupyter lab in the browser:

- File > Hub Control Panel > Stop my server

If you are in RStudio and you still have the Jupyter lab tab open in your browser:

- Go to the Jupyter lab tab
- File > Hub Control Panel > Stop my server

If you are in RStudio and you do not have the Jupyter lab tab open in your browser because you closed that tab:

- Go to the url `https://<jupyterhub url>/user/<your username in the hub>/lab/` That will open the Jupyter lab tab
- File > Hub Control Panel > Stop my server



- Close out your JupyterHub instance if you are finished for the day, following [these instructions](https://podaac.github.io/2022-SWOT-Ocean-Cloud-Workshop/tutorials/00_Setup.html#how-do-i-end-my-session).
