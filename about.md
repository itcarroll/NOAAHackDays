The content and tutorials today will be a mix of a workshop by the NASA Openscapes mentors at AGU Dec 10, 2023: [2023 Cloud AGU Workshop](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2023-Cloud-Workshop-AGU/) and content developed by Carl Boettiger for NASA TOPS-T [Cloud Native Geospatial in R & Python](https://boettiger-lab.github.io/nasa-topst-env-justice/).

### Workshop Goals

This is a session for interested NOAA staff to gain more familiarity with JupyterHubs and working with NASA Earth Data via code and geospatial packages in R and Python. This session is part of development of larger hack day events in 2024.

- Provide an inclusive place to learn and practice new skills
- Get more practice working in a JupyterHub with R and Python
- Learn about and experience working with earth data in the cloud;
- Practice using remote-sensing data in R and Python with code. 
- Learn by working together on a small group project/task. 


### Workshop Description

*From the NASA (Data Centers) Openscapes mentors*:

"Earth science data, including [NASA Earthdata](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/), is increasingly more available from the cloud. By leveraging cloud compute resources, open science principles, and technologies that foster transparency and reproducibility, science can be done at rates and scales that are not achievable by using personal/local machines. Building modern data skills in a friendly environment is crucial for accelerating science and reducing barriers to inclusive scientific research."

FAQ: Can I bring my own content/code to the event and JupyterHub? Absolutely, please do!!

### More earth data tutorials to explore!

Check out: [https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/tutorials/](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/tutorials/)

How do I get the tutorials into the JHub? clone this [https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/](https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/) and then look in the examples folder.

How do I clone? Since these are Jupyter/Python notebooks, easiest is cloning via Jupyter Lab.

* Go to Jupyter lab. How? I closed the tab. Open the JHub url again.
* Click on the little file icon on left until you are at the home directory.
* Click on the little Git icon on left. Which is it? Click on all the icons until you find it.
* When you see the 'Clone repository' button, click that. Paste in the url of the GitHub repo.  I don't see 'Clone repository'. Go back to step 1. You are not in the home directory yet.
