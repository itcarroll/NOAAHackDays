The content and tutorials will be a mix of content from workshops by the [NASA Openscapes mentors](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io) (for example [2023 Cloud AGU Workshop](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2023-Cloud-Workshop-AGU/)), content developed by Carl Boettiger for NASA TOPS-T [Cloud Native Geospatial in R & Python](https://boettiger-lab.github.io/nasa-topst-env-justice/), content by [NMFS CoastWatch](https://github.com/coastwatch-training/CoastWatch-Tutorials), and other internal tutorials.

### HackHour Goals

These sessions are for NOAA staff to gain more familiarity with JupyterHubs and working with spatial data, esp big data hosted in the cloud in databses, via code and via geospatial packages in R and Python. 

- Provide an inclusive place to learn and practice new skills
- Get practice working in a JupyterHub with R and Python
- Learn about and experience working with earth data in the cloud;
- Practice using remote-sensing data in R and Python with code. 
- Learn by working together on small projects.
- Give you the skills to be able to join hackweeks focused on big earth data.

### Description

*From the NASA (Data Centers) Openscapes mentors*:

"Earth science data, including [NASA Earthdata](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/), is increasingly more available from the cloud. By leveraging cloud compute resources, open science principles, and technologies that foster transparency and reproducibility, science can be done at rates and scales that are not achievable by using personal/local machines. Building modern data skills in a friendly environment is crucial for accelerating science and reducing barriers to inclusive scientific research."

## Why would I want to work in the cloud?

Watch this video on "Enabling Analysis in the Cloud Using NASA Earth Science Data" by [Michele Thorton](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/michele-m-thornton), a NASA Openscapes mentor from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center.

### More earth data tutorials to explore!

Check out: [https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/tutorials/](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/tutorials/)

How do I get these tutorials into the JHub? clone this [https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/](https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/) and then look in the examples folder.

How do I clone? Since these are Jupyter/Python notebooks, easiest is cloning via Jupyter Lab.

* Go to Jupyter lab. How? I closed the tab. Open the JHub url again.
* Click on the little file icon on left until you are at the home directory.
* Click on the little Git icon on left. Which is it? Click on all the icons until you find it.
* When you see the 'Clone repository' button, click that. Paste in the url of the GitHub repo.  I don't see 'Clone repository'. Go back to step 1. You are not in the home directory yet.


### FAQ

* Can I bring my own content/code to the event and JupyterHub? Absolutely, please do!! You can clone a GitHub repo or just upload files into the hub.
